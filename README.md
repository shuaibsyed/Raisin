# Raisin
This project simulates a very simple processor called the MAD Raisin. This CPU has a limited set of instructions and acesses a small portion of memory. Each of the different instructions has a code which the machine knows and that tells it which registers are being used and if the code uses memory. The program can tell the user which register has been used and if memory has been used.
